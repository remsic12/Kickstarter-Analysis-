# An Analysis on Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to help advise Louise on her own Kickstarter funded campaign
'The first takeaway from our analysis has found that there is potential for successful Theatre (US) and Musical (GB) Kickstarter campaigns, but you need to re-examine your goals.
''It is also good to know that in the US Theater campaigns were the most successful of any parent category  

![US Parent Category](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79228491/122996688-c469d480-d370-11eb-8b13-90b0c2d77bf1.png)

"Our biggest takeaways came from the below chart which gave us our measures of central tendencies to ter understand the keys to successful and failed campaigns. We found that the higher the goal the more likely the campaign is to fail. Looking at your proposal you are asking for more than 2x the average successful Kickstarter goal. 

![Central Tendencies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79228491/122996316-5cb38980-d370-11eb-8272-6ae631966aec.png)

''To run a successful Theatre (US) we advise you to run your fundraiser in May, (111) or June (100). As you can see below this where we saw the highest number of successful theatre Kickstarter campaigns. 

![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79228491/122996126-18c08480-d370-11eb-834c-3fe6b9fc5331.png)

'You also mentioned a Musical campaign in Great Britain with an estimated budget of $4,000. We have found some encouraging data around this budget and location. Our analysis did however show you will want to try to get your play produced for less than $4,000. As you can below, Theater was the most successful parent category in Great Britain (604)

![GB Parent Category](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79228491/122996726-d0ee2d00-d370-11eb-90be-f1da520a7851.png)

''If you look at the subcategories within Theater you will see plays are the most successful but musicals do have some success they just aren't as frequent.

![GB Subcategory Theater](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79228491/122997163-54a81980-d371-11eb-81f7-7f2beeef1421.png)

''As stated previously you will want to get your play produced for less than $4,000 because as you can see from the graphic below the mean campaign goal is around $4,000. This number is outside of the range of outliers for amounts pledged. The median is $2,00 meaning half of the campaign goals are less than $2,000. You can also see the pledged data (orange box) showing that the goal amount was only hit less than half the time, but when goal amount is $2000 or less it was hit 70%

'Lastly you asked about the 5 plays from the Edinburg Festival Fringer, here look at those plays. While all 5 hit their goal 4 of them had relatively small goals ($2k and under) another data point showing that you should reconsider your goal amount.

#Module 1 Challenge
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project we analyzed data on Kickstarter Campaigns to provide Louise with insights on running a succesful Kickstart Campaign. As you will see we have used visuals (charts and graphs) to help give Louise a more consise
and easy to comprehend look at the data we were provided. Along with the charts and graphs we provided our own analysis around a reccomendation for success and also highlighted any shortcomings in the data set we were provided.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to help identify the best time of the year and the best goal amount to set in order for Louise to run a successful Kickstart Campaign for her play Fever

## Analysis and Challenges
 Markup : * Analysis
              * Based on the factors in which we have provided an analysis on (Launch Date and Goals) we have concluded there is a correct time of year to launch your campaign as well as a general fundraising goal in order to be successfull
		*We will provide the data, graphs and charts below on our findings.
	*Challenges
		*Lack of information we have about your campaign for Fever. 
			*It would be helpful if you could share with us your budget as well as how much time you have to run your campaign.
		*The amount of data we have compared to the amount of kickstart campaigns is quite minimal, while we were able to provide some analysis based on the dataset I feel if we had included more kickstarter campaign data we could provide better analysis

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 Markup : * Below you will find a line graph that will help outline when to launch a successfull campaign.
		*As you can see in the graph May and June are the most successfull launch months
		*December is the worst month to launch a campaign and October also sees a low success rate

![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79228491/122998365-8e2d5480-d372-11eb-86dc-86467d91a873.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Markup : * Below you will find another line graph which will help outline what Goal ammounts are most successful  
		*As you can see from the graph setting too high or too low will have an impact on your campaign being successfull or not

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Markup : * There was minimal challanges in producing the analysis for your Kickstarter Campaign, however as stated already there were challanges based around not having enough information from you to provide better insight.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Markup : 1. May and June are the best launch months 
              1. May had 111 successful Theatre Launches 
              2. June had 100 successful Theatre Launches
          2. Not only did May and June have the most succesful launches they also had the highest success %
		1. May had a 67% success rate 
		2. June had a 65% success rate
	3. December was the worst launch month
		1. December had the lowest success rate (49%) and the highest failure rate (47%)

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Markup: 1. Too high of a goal will likely lead to a failed campaign
		1. The Successful campaigns had much smaller Mean and Median Goals.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 Markup : * The data is not recent
              * Data is from 2010-2017
          * We have data on length of successful campaigns but we do not know how much time Louise has for her campaign. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 Markup : * Analysis on Backers 
              * If we provided Louise with some visuals on the mean number of backers for successful and failed campaigns we could advise her on how many backers to seek 
          * Analysis on Length of Successful vs Failed Campaigns.
